Welcome to ACTFC!



ACTFC is a CTF website template for linear CTFs. It uses encryption in order to hide future challenges so it forces the user to solve one challenge at a time until they eventually reach the ending.



ACTFC is completely portable and designed to be able to plug into larger websites with ease. It is preconfigured to run on it's own already and only requires small edits to be incorporated into a larger website.



My goal when creating this project was to provide ease-of-use to beginner CTF creators. When attaching challenges, everything is automatically done inside 'challenge-add.py'. There is no need to edit any other file unless you plan to incorporate ACTFC into your website.
